# JTermEmu
This is a terminal emulator written in Java, currently only as a proof of concept that it actually works in realtime at 60 fps, even on lower-spec hardware. I wrote the same program roughly 20 years ago, but lost its source code. So I rewrote it.

It has many features like overline, underline, double underline, slow blink, fast blink, color, thin, bold, blacken and various strike-out modes.

In this repo, you'll currently only find its Eclipse files until I've decided on a build tool chain.

Of course, it is planned to turn it into a real terminal emulator one of these days (i.e. so that it can be used to run shells, for instance). For now, it's just a demonstrator.
